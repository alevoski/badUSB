# BadUSB
[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/plateform-windows%20%7C%20linux-lightgrey.svg)  

This project is a study about bad-USB.  
Project in construction  

## Intro ##
BadUSB devices areUSB devices with a cpu that can execute scripts automatically  
when they are mount on a computer.  
Computers reconize them as "trust worthly devices" like HID device (ie : Keyboard)  
They cannot be detected by antivirus.  
A badUSB device can do the same ction than a keyboard.


## How to protect ? ##
Sevaral actions can be done to prevent troubles :  
 - Autolock computer option is not sufficiant : if you leave your computer just lock your session  
 - Don't use your administrator privileges if you don't need them  
 - Never trust unrecognized USB devices (and any devices gloabaly)  
    you should at least scan the device for viruses (with [Decontamine_Linux](https://github.com/alevoski/decontamine_Linux)  
    rembembere that a classic antivirus will not detect anything from an encoded binanry payload  
    any doubts : don't insert the device on your computer !  
    keep in mind that some rogue USB devices can simply [physically destroy your computer](https://thehackernews.com/2016/09/usb-kill-computer.html)  
- For Windows sysadmin : a secure kind of GPO will save your use rs from this
    - Block access to CMD by all means 
    - Disable Windows shortcuts
    - Block access to control panel 
    - Or at least, your users shouldn't have administrator rights

## Getting Started
Download the project on your computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/alevoski/badUSB.git
```

### Prerequisites
[An Hak5 Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe)  
A SD card  
A SD card reader  
[Hak5 tools to create payloads](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky)  

### HOW TO REPRODUCE THE EXAMPLES ?
I provide the encoded payload but if you prefer you can go to the EXAMPLES/ folder and make the payload yourself  
```
java -jar encoder.jar -i <pathofyourcodetobeencoded> -o <outputpath> -l <yourlangage>
java -jar encoder.jar -i /home/userX/hello -o /home/userX/hello.bin -l en
```

#### Demos (Windows OS)
